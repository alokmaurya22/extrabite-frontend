# 🍽️ ExtraBite: Save Food, Feed Lives

[Live Site](https://extrabite.vercel.app) • [Github URL (BACKEND)](https://github.com/alokmaurya22/extrabite-backend-2) • [Swagger Docs](https://extrabite-backend-2.onrender.com/swagger-ui) 

**ExtraBite** is a full-stack web platform that connects food donors with receivers (NGOs or individuals) to reduce food wastage and hunger. Whether you're a household, restaurant, or organization, ExtraBite makes it easy to donate leftover food — and even easier for those in need to find it, request it, and collect it.

## 💡 Mission

To reduce food wastage and fight hunger by using technology to enable fast, safe, and efficient redistribution of surplus food.

Even if this platform helps prevent just one meal from being wasted and that meal reaches one hungry person — it’s absolutely worth it.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

ExtraBite enables:

- Live food posting with geo-location and expiry handling
- Real-time food listing for receivers
- OTP-based handover system
- Role-based dashboards for donors, receivers, and admins
- Admin control panel with platform analytics and user management

We built separate **frontend** and **backend** stacks, connected via secure **REST APIs** with role-based JWT authentication and custom headers.

## 🧩 App Flow: How It Works

### 👤 Registration & Role Selection

- Users register as **Donor**, **Receiver**, or **Admin**
- Donors can optionally add FSSAI license numbers
- Location is auto-picked using browser geolocation

### 🍱 Donor Flow

- Submit food details: item name, quantity, expiry, food type, images, pickup info
- Food auto-expires if not picked up in time (2-4 hrs based on conditions)
- Donor dashboard shows analytics, donation history, and request status

### 📦 Receiver Flow

- Browse and filter nearby donations
- Request food → Notify donor → Receive OTP if accepted
- Provide OTP at pickup for verification

### 🛡️ Admin Flow

- Approve/block users
- Monitor usage, donation analytics, health status
- View reports and control misuse
